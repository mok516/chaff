# Introduction 
Working with the **chaff** data set, this data records the masses of male and female chaffinches.  
## Methods
Use R analysis to calculate the **sum of squares** from the **mass** values 

```{r data}
# read in chaff data
chaff <- read.table("raw_data/chaff.txt", header = TRUE)
str(chaff)

# tidy chaff data
chaff2 <- pivot_longer(data = chaff, cols = everything(),
                       names_to = "sex", values_to = "mass")
str(chaff2)
file <-  "../workshop1-58Mworking/chaff2.txt"
# save to file 
write.table(chaff2, 
            file, 
            quote = FALSE,
            row.names = FALSE)
```
### Results 
The difference in masses between sex
