# Introduction 
In this review I will be looking into data collected concerning **chaffinches**. Chaffinches are a member of the Finch family often recognizable by the coloring of their plumage or loud song [@rspb].  
The data set used for this analysis (called chaff) has recorded the **masses** of both male and female chaffinches, see Figures\@ref(fig:malechaff-fig), and  \@ref(fig:chafffem-fig).  
Working with the **chaff** data set, this data records the masses of male and female chaffinches. Before beginning this analysis I *hypothesized* that the **males** would be **heavier** than the females. Previous studies of chaffinches have displayed that the male birds tend to have a higher average weight [@chaffbiomet].

```{r malechaff-fig, out.width="30%", fig.cap = "Male Chaffinches have a recognisable red plumage, Photo from Wikipedia, Common Chaffinch, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_chaffinch"}
knitr::include_graphics("../chaff/chaffmale.jpg")
```
<!-- insert next pic -->

```{r chafffem-fig, out.width="30%", fig.cap= "Female Chaffinches have a borwn plumage unlike the males, Photo from Wikipedia, Common Chaffinch, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_chaffinch"}
knitr::include_graphics("../chaff/chaff_female.jpg")
```

## Methods
Use R analysis within *Rmarkdown* [@markdown] to calculate the **sum of squares** from the **mass** values. 

```{r data}
# read in chaff data
chaff <- read.table("raw_data/chaff.txt", header = TRUE)
str(chaff)

# tidy chaff data
chaff2 <- pivot_longer(data = chaff, cols = everything(),
                       names_to = "sex", values_to = "mass")
str(chaff2)
file <-  "../chaff/chaff2.txt"
# save to file 
write.table(chaff2, 
            file, 
            quote = FALSE,
            row.names = FALSE)
```
<!-- code chunk for SS(x) -->
```{r analysis}
sum_sq <- function(df, measure) {
  df %>% summarise(ss = sum(({{measure}} - mean({{measure}}))^2))
}

sum_sq(chaff2, mass)

# adapt to calculate SS(x) for each group
sum_sq <- function(df, measure, group) {
  df %>% group_by({{ group }}) %>% 
    summarise(ss = sum(({{measure}} - mean({{measure}}))^2))
}

sum_sq(chaff2, mass, sex)
```
<!-- summarize by sex - include the mean, standard deviation, sample size and standard error -->
```{r summarise}
chaff_summary <- chaff2 %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(mean_index = mean(mass),
            n = length (mass),
            sd = sd(mass),
            se = sd/sqrt(n))
chaff_summary
```
<!-- make into a function -->
```{r function}
chaff_summary <- function(summarise) {{chaff2 %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(mean_index = mean(mass),
            n = length (mass),
            sd = sd(mass),
            se = sd/sqrt(n))}
  }
```



### Results 

Summary of data shows a **mean** of 20.480 for **females** and for **males** 22.275 . With **males** having a *Standard deviation* of 2.151 and a *Standard error* of 0.481. 
For females the results were, a *Standard deviation* of 2.138 and a *Standard error* of 0.478.

#### Discussion 
**Male** chaffinches appear to be *heavier* than **Females** from this data, having a *higher* mean **mass**. Despite having *slightly higher* standard deviations and standard errors the results are conclusive.
